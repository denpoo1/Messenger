# Installation 🏁

To get started with the Run App, follow these steps:

1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:
   - If you're on Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - On Linux or macOS, use the Terminal.

2. Navigate to the Directory:
   - Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you saved the docker-compose.yml file.
```bash
cd /path/to/your/docker-compose-directory
```

3. Run Docker Compose:
   - Execute the following command to start the Docker Compose process. Replace docker-compose.yml with the actual filename if it's different.
```bash
docker-compose up
```

4. Wait for Completion:
   - Docker will download the necessary images and start the containers. This might take some time depending on your internet connection.

6. Access Your Application:
   - Once the process completes, you should see output indicating that your application is running. Access it through a web browser or another specified method.

7. Stopping the Containers:
   - To stop the running containers, open a new terminal window, navigate to the same directory, and run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## CI/CD

Step 1. Build:
 -  Checkout the repository.
 - Set up JDK 20 using the AdoptOpenJDK distribution.
 - Build the project using Maven, skipping tests.

Step 2. Tests:
 - Checkout the repository.
 - Set up JDK 20.
 - Run tests using Maven.
   
Step 3. Deploy to Docker Hub:
 - Checkout the repository.
 - Authenticate with Google using provided credentials.
 - Install dependencies.
 - Copy secrets from Google Secret Manager.
 - Set up Docker Buildx.
 - Login to Docker Hub.
 - Build Docker image and push it to Docker Hub.
   
Step 4. ArgoCD Image Updater:
 - ArgoCD image updater monitors dockerhub for new container versions. If a new version of the container appears, it changes the kubernates manifest files and commits to the repository with the manifest files

Step 5. ArgoCD:
 - Monitors the Git repository with manifest files. If changes appear in the manifest files, deployment occurs to the kubernates cluster
